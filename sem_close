[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       [1msem_open[22m()  creates a new POSIX semaphore or opens an existing semaphore.  The semaphore is identified by [4mname[24m.  For de‐
       tails of the construction of [4mname[24m, see [1msem_overview[22m(7).

       The [4moflag[24m argument specifies flags that control the operation of the call.  (Definitions of the flags values can be  ob‐
       tained  by including [4m<fcntl.h>[24m.)  If [1mO_CREAT [22mis specified in [4moflag[24m, then the semaphore is created if it does not already
       exist.  The owner (user ID) of the semaphore is set to the effective user ID of the calling process.  The  group  owner‐
       ship  (group  ID)  is set to the effective group ID of the calling process.  If both [1mO_CREAT [22mand [1mO_EXCL [22mare specified in
       [4moflag[24m, then an error is returned if a semaphore with the given [4mname[24m already exists.

       If [1mO_CREAT [22mis specified in [4moflag[24m, then two additional arguments must be supplied.  The [4mmode[24m argument specifies the  per‐
       missions  to  be placed on the new semaphore, as for [1mopen[22m(2).  (Symbolic definitions for the permissions bits can be ob‐
       tained by including [4m<sys/stat.h>[24m.)  The permissions settings are masked against the process umask.  Both read and  write
       permission  should  be  granted  to each class of user that will access the semaphore.  The [4mvalue[24m argument specifies the
       initial value for the new semaphore.  If [1mO_CREAT [22mis specified, and a semaphore with the given [4mname[24m already exists,  then
       [4mmode[24m and [4mvalue[24m are ignored.

[1mRETURN VALUE[0m
       On  success,  [1msem_open[22m() returns the address of the new semaphore; this address is used when calling other semaphore-re‐
       lated functions.  On error, [1msem_open[22m() returns [1mSEM_FAILED[22m, with [4merrno[24m set to indicate the error.

[1mERRORS[0m
       [1mEACCES [22mThe semaphore exists, but the caller does not have permission to open it.

       [1mEEXIST [22mBoth [1mO_CREAT [22mand [1mO_EXCL [22mwere specified in [4moflag[24m, but a semaphore with this [4mname[24m already exists.

       [1mEINVAL [4m[22mvalue[24m was greater than [1mSEM_VALUE_MAX[22m.

       [1mEINVAL [4m[22mname[24m consists of just "/", followed by no other characters.

       [1mEMFILE [22mThe per-process limit on the number of open file descriptors has been reached.

       [1mENAMETOOLONG[0m
              [4mname[24m was too long.

       [1mENFILE [22mThe system-wide limit on the total number of open files has been reached.

       [1mENOENT [22mThe [1mO_CREAT [22mflag was not specified in [4moflag[24m and no semaphore with this [4mname[24m exists; or,  [1mO_CREAT  [22mwas  specified,
              but [4mname[24m wasn't well formed.

       [1mENOMEM [22mInsufficient memory.
